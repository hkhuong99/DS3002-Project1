Welcome! If you've just come to America for the first time, you may notice that we measure distance and temperature in different units.

If you're trying to convert your temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, please enter your temperature as a number.
  You do this using the "convert_c_to_f" endpoint.
  This conversion is done by multiplying the temperature in Celsius by 9/5 and then adding 32.

If you're trying to convert your distance from kilometers to miles, please enter your distance as a number.
  You do this using the "convert_km_to_miles" endpoint.
  This conversion is done by dividing the distance in kilometers by 1.609344.

In America, if you have someone's zipcode, you can also learn a lot about them!

  You can find out the city they live in by entering their zipcode as a 5 digit number after the "city" endpoint.
    This is done by using a zipcode API and getting the city associated with a zipcode.
    
  You can also find out the area codes for that general area by entering their zipcode as a 5 digit number after the "areacodes" endpoint.
    This is done by using a zipcode API and getting the area code associated with a zipcode.
    
  Lastly, you can also find the distance between two locations by entering the zipcodes as 5 digit numbers after the "distance" endpoint separately with each     
  zipcode acting as its own parameter.
    This is done by using a zipcode API and getting the distance between two zipcodes.
